# SpaceInvaders
Project done in my 1st Year enveloping Hardware in VHDL and Software in Kotlin to recreate the classic SpaceInvaders Game on a MAX10 FPGA Board


To run the program is very simple, just access the USB_PORT.properties in the Software folder and switch the #simulation according to the situation, if you have the FPGA MAXDE10 LITE board switch it to false and run the APP.kt file, without the board you can use the simulation program just by switching the simulation line to true and running the APP.kt

 
# ----------------------------------------
# ---     DEVICE configuration         ---
# ----------------------------------------
# device            = de10lite
# simulation        = false / true
# simulation_target = java
# file              = hardware.simul
# ----------------------------------------


The project guide as everything needed to know about the game and each command and keybind to play.
